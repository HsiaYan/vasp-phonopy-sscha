This step-by-step guide will guide you the workflow. 

1) unzip the MLFF.zip folder. After that, unzip the ML_FF.zip file, that contatins an accurate Force Field for the C2 diamond.

2) Generating the harmonic guess
  i) phonopy -d --dim='5 5 5'
  ii) cp POSCAR poscar-unitcell
  iii) cp SPOSCAR POSCAR
  iv) *Run VASP in order to generate the dynamical matrix at Gamma, on the 5x5x5 supercell*
  v) phonopy --fc vasprun.xml

3) Run the interface,py for creating the first QE dynamical matrix, starting from the FORCE_CONSTANTS matrix file generated by PHONOPY
  i) python /path_to_folder/vasp-phonopy-sscha-main/vasp-phonopy-sscha/interface.py
  ii) Time to insert the prompts, when asked:
   
    Which is your PHONOPY supercell? 5 
    Do you want to interpolate the dynamical matrix? y
    To which QxQxQ grid you want to interpolate? 5
    How many random ensembles you want to generate? 1000
    Which population is this? 1
    How many irreducible dyn/dynq do you have in the dyn folder, after the eventual interpolation?? 10
    At which temperature you want to generate the ensembles? 0
    Do you want to positivize the dynamical matrix? n
 
 4) Understanding the generated folder structure
      ./pop/dyn contains the QE dynamical matrixes, grouped by symmetry. In this case, we have 10 irreducible q-points.
      ./pop/dyn_old contains the Gamma-point dyn matrix before the interpolation
      ./pop/data/position contains the stochastic ensembles
      ./pop/data contains the displacements of the stochastic ensemble from the undisplaced supercell
      ./pop/vasp contains the stochastic supercell ensembles in VASP format
      
 5) Run the eneegies,forces,stress calculations on the stochastic ensembles

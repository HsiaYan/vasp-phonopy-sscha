This step-by-step guide will guide you the workflow. Even if focus on how to use the vasp-phonopy-sscha interface,
some explanation pertaining SSCHA will also be given. In any case, a complete guide on SSCHA can be found on the official website:

############## http://sscha.eu/

LET'S START

1) unzip the C2.zip folder. After that, unzip the ML_FF.zip file, that contatins an accurate Force Field for the C2 diamond.

2) Generating the harmonic guess

  i) phonopy -d --dim='3 3 3'
  ii) cp POSCAR poscar-unitcell
  iii) cp SPOSCAR POSCAR
  iv) cp INCAR.harmonic INCAR (and run VASP in order to generate the dynamical matrix at Gamma, on the 3x3x3 supercell)
  v) cp POSCAR SPOSCAR, cp poscar-unitcell POSCAR (for the next step in phonopy, we need again to have the unitcell saved as POSCAR)
  vi) phonopy --fc vasprun.xml

3) Run the interface.py for creating the first QE dynamical matrix, starting from the FORCE_CONSTANTS matrix file generated by PHONOPY. At the moment of calling “interface.py” the POSCAR must contain the unit-cell instead of the 333 supercell for the finite displacements.
  i) python /path_to_folder/vasp-phonopy-sscha-main/vasp-phonopy-sscha/interface.py
  ii) Time to insert the prompts, when asked:

    Which is your PHONOPY supercell? 3                ### On a 3x3x3 we could get a good harmonic guess
    Do you want to interpolate the dynamical matrix? y
    To which QxQxQ grid you want to interpolate? 3    ##but obviously can be different from the PHONOPY supercell
    How many random ensembles you want to generate? 300
    Which population is this? 1
    How many irreducible dyn/dynq do you have in the dyn folder, after the eventual interpolation?? 4 (you can check it from another terminal window)
    At which temperature you want to generate the ensembles? 0
    Do you want to positivize the dynamical matrix? n

 4) Understanding the generated folder structure
      ./pop1/dyn contains the QE dynamical matrixes, grouped by symmetry. In this case, we have 10 irreducible q-points.
      ./pop1/dyn_old contains the Gamma-point dyn matrix before the interpolation
      ./pop1/data/position contains the stochastic ensembles
      ./pop1/data contains the displacements of the stochastic ensemble from the undisplaced supercell
      ./pop1/vasp contains the stochastic supercell ensembles in VASP format

 5) Run the enegies,forces,stress calculations on the stochastic ensembles. In our example, we use the Machine Learning Force Field
 implemented in VASP (ML_FF). You can try it out. We just need the minimal INCAR.sc for this. At the end of the calculation we need to have:
      ./pop1/vasp/energies : a file with an ordered list (1..300) of the GS energies of every ensemble in eV
      ./pop1/vasp/forces/forces_population1_*.dat a folder containing (1..300) .dat files with the forces acting on each atom in an ensemble.
 you can check out the file formats in the respective "energies" and "forces" files already given.
 If feel lazy, just copy those two files into ./pop1/vasp, and go to point 6).

 6) Converting the energies and forces from VASP to QE format, and put them in the ./pop/data folder, as SSCHA prescribes.
  i) Go to the ./pop1 folder.
  ii) cp POSCAR vasp (we need the unit cell POSCAR in the vasp folder: it is required by the foloowing scripts)
  iii)  python /path_to_folder/vasp-phonopy-sscha-main/vasp-phonopy-sscha/interface.py --en_processing 1
  iv) python /path_to_folder/vasp-phonopy-sscha-main/vasp-phonopy-sscha/interface.py --f_processing 1 3
  ######## Running interface.py -h will help you understanding these flags.

 7) At this point, we are free to run the SSCHA minimization of the free energy wrt atomic positions and the dynamical matrix. The comments
    on the python scripts try to make all the parameters understandable, but for any doubt, just refer to the SSCHA documentation.
  i) python python_minimizer.py > minim1.out
  ii) After the minimization, you will se the minim1.dat, minim1.freqs and minim1.out files. minim1.out contains the bare minimizarion steps,
    while minim1.freqs and minim1.dat contain the info that we can now plot through:
    sscha-plot-data.py minim1 (this script is a SSCHA script. It search for the {argument}.freqs and {argument}.dat files).

 9) If everyithing went smooth, you should find in ./pop/dyn/ the new dynamical matrixes. Copy them in a new ./pop2/dyn folder, and rename them as dynq*
  i) cd ./pop2 1
  ii) python /path_to_folder/vasp-phonopy-sscha-main/vasp-phonopy-sscha/interface.py --generate 500 2 4 0
  iiia) You will obtain a ./pop2/data folder with 500 ensembles generated at 0K.
  iiib)If you wanted for example to interpolate to a bigger q-grid (that is, to a bigger commensurate supercell, you could have run:
      python /path_to_folder/vasp-phonopy-sscha-main/vasp-phonopy-sscha/interface.py --interpolate 3 4,
      with which we are interpolate from a 3x3x3 q-mesh to a 4x4x4 q-mesh
  iV) Create a "vasp" directory in ./pop2. In order to obtain the POSCAR files in the VASP directory, run
      python /path_to_folder/vasp-phonopy-sscha-main/vasp-phonopy-sscha/interface.py --to_vasp 2 3

 10) And so on, until convergence

 Mind: As you could see, we invoke the bare interface.py just once, to go from the harmonic guess to the first population. After that, we
 operate with interface.py --flags, to do the necessary steps one by one.
